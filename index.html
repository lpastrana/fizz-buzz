	    <p>Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".</p>
	    <p>For this test, we have a preselected sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 to run the FIZZ BUZZ game. If the number is divisible by 3 the number will be replaced by the word 'FIZZ'. If the number is divisible by 5 it will be substituted with 'BUZZ'. If it is divisible by both the phrase 'FIZZ BUZZ' will appear. Finally, if it does not match any of those three situations it will diplay the number.</p>
